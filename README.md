# Portfolio

#### _Web Portfolio, submitted for Epicodus code review August 3rd, 2018._

### _Created by_ **Joseph Friesen**

## Description

This project is a single web page meant to serve as an overview of the coding projects I have completed here at Epicodus, as well as a personal profile for myself. The Coding Projects section gives a small snapshot, short description, and link to the GitHub repository for each of the projects I have completed in my first week, and can be expanded and edited in the future as new projects are completed. Below that is the About Me section, which provides a short summary of my education and employment history, as well as some hobbies that I enjoy. The page is styled employing many of the concepts learned here in this first week.
